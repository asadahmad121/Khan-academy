## Info about me

My name is Hamza Ahmad, I currently work in VISA as a technical business analyst but hope to move to a more technical role, purpose of this project is to showcase progression with regards to improving my technical skills (for potential future employer). I hope to make it into a habit of posting here regularly even if its spending half an hour everyday. Important thing is small but consistent steps, "The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones".
